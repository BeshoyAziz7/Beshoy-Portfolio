# 🌟 Welcome to My Personal Portfolio! 🌟

Hey there! I'm Beshoy, and this is my corner of the internet – my personal portfolio website, crafted with a lot of passion and code! 🎉 It's designed to give you a glimpse into my world as a Computer Science graduate, showcasing my work in Web Development, UI/UX Design, and Game Design. As of June 11, 2025, this is my latest creation, and I'm really excited for you to explore it. 🚀

## ✨ What You'll Find Inside ✨

I've packed this portfolio with some cool features I'm really proud of:

* **A Fun Welcome**: When you first land, you'll see a dynamic preloader where my name "Beshoy" scrambles and resolves – a little playful intro to start your journey!
* **An Engaging Background**: I've integrated `particles.js` to create an interactive, flowing background that adds a modern and artistic touch to the whole experience. ✨
* **My Specialties, Typed Out**: On the home section, you'll see a cool typewriter effect dynamically displaying what I do: "Creative Web Designs 🌐", "Games 🎮", and "Apps 📱". I even added some neat Font Awesome icons in there!
* **Smooth Navigation**: I designed a sticky navigation bar that stays at the top as you scroll, making it super easy to jump between different sections of my site. 🧭
* **An Interactive Cursor**: I implemented a custom cursor that's a small dot, followed by a larger circle. It reacts to your movements and changes when you hover over interactive elements, making the Browse experience more engaging. 🖱️
* **Getting to Know Me**: In the "About" section, I share a bit about my academic journey and skills. You'll see my profile picture with a cool overlay effect on hover, and some animated stats like my "Years Experience", "Projects Completed", and "Happy Clients" that count up as you scroll past them!
* **My Skill Set, Visualized**: The "Skills" section is where you can see my proficiency levels for various technical and game development skills, presented with animated progress bars that fill up as they come into view. 🎯
* **My Projects, Categorized**: This is where I showcase my work! You can filter them by "Web Development" and "Games". For UI/UX Design and Mobile Apps, I'm still working on projects and will upload them as soon as possible. Each project includes a description, the technologies I used, and links to demos or their GitHub repos. 💡
* **Reach Out to Me!**: There's a contact form where you can send me a message directly. I'd love to hear from you! ✉️
* **Quick Scroll to Top**: For your convenience, a little button appears when you scroll down, allowing you to quickly jump back to the top of the page. ⬆️
* **Designed for Everyone**: I made sure this portfolio is fully responsive, so it looks great and works perfectly whether you're viewing it on a desktop, tablet, or phone. 📱💻

## 🛠️ The Tech Behind It 🛠️

Here's a quick look at the technologies I used to build this portfolio:

* **HTML5**: This forms the fundamental structure of every page you see. 🏗️
* **CSS3**: I used CSS to bring all the designs to life, from the responsive layout to the smooth animations and custom effects. 🎨
* **JavaScript**: This is where the magic happens! It powers all the interactivity, dynamic content, and engaging animations you'll experience. ✨
* **Font Awesome**: For all the cool icons you see around the site, like in my typewriter effect, skill icons, and project links, I used Font Awesome. 🌟
* **particles.js**: This library is what I used to create the interactive particle background, adding that extra layer of visual appeal. 🌠
* **typed.js**: The library responsible for the captivating "typewriter" effect you'll see on the home page. 📝
